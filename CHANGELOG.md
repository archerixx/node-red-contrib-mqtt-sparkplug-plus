### 0.0.4: Maintenance Release

Fixed
 - Removed dead code
 - Updated documentation with Optional Metrics timestamp (#1)
 - Moved more messages to message catalog (internationalization)
 - Support for metrics with NULL values
 - Added this change log
 - MQTT lib buffer functionality is now enabled. This will enable buffering of messages when the node is not connected to a broker (It still need to connect before it starts buffering).
 - started adding unit tests (very limited coverage)
